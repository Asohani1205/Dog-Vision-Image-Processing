# Dog-Vision-Image-Processing

We will build an AI model to classify different dog breeds. First, we will gather thousands of images of various dog breeds. We will preprocess the images by resizing them, normalizing the pixel values, and augmenting them to generate more data. Then we will build a Convolutional Neural Network in TensorFlow using Keras, with convolutional layers to extract features, max pooling and dropout for regularization, and dense layers for classification.

We will train the model on our dataset for dozens of epochs until it achieves decent accuracy. We will evaluate the model on a hold-out test set and analyze its per-breed accuracy. We can then use the model to classify and predict the breeds of new dog images. To improve the model, we can apply data augmentation, use a deeper network architecture, add more training data, customize hyperparameters, or ensemble multiple models. Finally, we can build a simple web app to deploy our model and create a dog breed classification tool that anyone can access.

That's a high-level project description in just one paragraph. Of course, turning this into a full Colab notebook will require many more technical details and steps, but this summarizes the key elements and goals of building a dog breed identification model in TensorFlow
